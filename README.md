#COVID-19 Simulation
###Please note that this simulation supersimplifies the reality!
A simulation of the covid-19 dissemination made with Processing and inspired by the 'Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to “flatten the curve”' article on the Washington Post and written by Harry Stevens.

The simulation has three cases:
* Everyone moving;
* 1/4 of initial population moving;
* 1/8 of initial population  moving;

You can see the results of the simulations on my Instagram (@menino.samuel) or you can download the code, run it by itself and make your modifications.

###Please help to stop the COVID-19 on World, don't get out, wash your hands, don't spread fake news, support education, science and public health systems! Thank you!
